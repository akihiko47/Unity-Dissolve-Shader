# ðŸ”® Unity BRP Dissolve Shader ðŸ”®

![banner](https://github.com/akihiko47/Unity-Dissolve-Shader/blob/main/Images/char.gif)

In this repository, I have implemented a dissolve shader. This shader is based on the standard built-in shader. This means that it supports all the functions of the standard shader (except for the render mode, here it is fixed as cutout). The shader is located at the `Custom/Dissolve` path of shader selection option in material inspector. On the picture below you can see the new settings section (all settings appear only after selecting the noise texture)

## Installation ðŸ”§
There are 2 ways:
- import `DissolveShader.unitypackage` via *Assets-Import* Package
- clone/download this repository and move the `Dissolve Shader` folder to your Unity project's Assets folder

## Noise ðŸ“·
The shader works with noise textures. There are 7 textures in the `Noise Textures` folder, you can experiment with them. You can download more textures [here](https://opengameart.org/content/700-noise-textures).

Thank you for reading this ðŸ˜Š!
